# 1. Executive Summary
## __Objectives__  
TO DO 

## __Recommendations__  
TO DO 

# 2. Program Design

## __2.1 Claim Requirements__  
To file a claim in relation to property damage from a climate-related catastrophe:
*  The damaged property must be the primary residence of the claimant
*  The claimant/claimants must be the owner/owners of the property
*  The property must not be utilised for business purposes

To file a claim in relation to equipment damage and temporary housing costs from a climate-related catastrophe:
*  The damaged property must be the primary residence of the claimant
*  The claimant/claimants must either own or rent the property
*  The property must not be utilised for business purposes

To file a claim in relation to temporary housing costs from a climate-related catastrophe:
*  The damaged property must be the primary residence of the claimant
*  The claimant/claimants must either own or rent the property
*  The property must not be utilised for business purposes
*  The property must be assessed as uninhabitable prior to repairs

For all claims, the claimant must be unable to create a claim with a commercial insurance company (Channels, 2022).

## __2.2 Coverage__  
The program covers all repair costs associated with property damage claims for owner occupied primary residences, all essential equipment repair/replacement costs (luxury goods not included) for both renters and owners of a primary residence and 3-month temporary relocation costs for renters or owners of a primary residence that has been impacted by a disaster substantially.

## __2.3 Voluntary Relocation Incentives__  
Our program incentivises voluntary relocation through a home buyback scheme and rent subsidy scheme for residents in high risk cities of a region (PLANNED RELOCATION, DISASTERS AND CLIMATE CHANGE, 2014).

### __2.3.1 Home Buyback Scheme__
The home buyback scheme produces a predefined number of offers each quarter to a percentage of owner-occupied households to each region's high-risk cities to purchase their house at market price. The bulk of offers occur within the first 10 years of the program to save in disaster displacement related costs long term. Eligibility requirements are the same as the property damage claim requirements and offers are made at the start of each quarter. By accepting the offer, the offeree agrees to moving out of the high risk city into a low risk city within the same region. If an offer is denied, the offer is transferred to another household in the high-risk city.

### __2.3.2 Rent Subsidy Scheme__
The rent subsidy scheme works similarly to the home buyback scheme, however to be eligible, you must be a renter, rather than an owner of your primary residence. Further, much more offers are made as it is more cost effective than buybacks and the bulk of the offers are made over the first 5 years. The subsidy covers 30% of rent costs over 6 months for eligible households that move from a high risk city in their region to a low risk city in their region.

## __2.4 Quantitative/Qualitative Justification__  
By incurring costs from the home buyback and rent subsidy scheme in the short term, we reduce our exposure to disaster displacement costs in the long term. By 2030 it is expected that roughly 70% of individuals living in high risk cities will relocate to low risk cities, resulting in a 70% reduction in exposure to 90% of major disasters, 85% of medium disasters and 75% of minor disasters.

## __2.5 Short Term and Long Term Evaulation__  
As the majority of costs from the buyback and renter scheme occur in the first 5-10 years, a 10 year timeframe was chosen for the short term. In the long term, a 150 year timeframe was chosen to capture the effects of climate change on disaster frequencies.

## __2.6 Key Metrics__  
Key metrics expected to be reported to ensure the objectives of the program are being met are:
*  	In the short term on a _quarterly basis_, monitoring that costs arising from involuntary displacement are decreasing at a sustainable rate.
*  	In the long term on a _quarterly basis_, monitoring whether costs arising from catastrophic climate-related events are substantially less than the costs that would have been expected without the program.
*  	Reporting on a _yearly basis_ over the long term to ensure the costs under the program are less than 10% of Storslysia’s GDP
*  	Monitoring on a _yearly basis_ over the long term which Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) the world is trending towards.


# 3. Pricing and Costs
Assessing the pricing and economic costs associated with the scheme is integral to ensuring its success. To achieve this, Storslysias’ economics costs were modelled and projected from the years 2020-2150 for all quarters 1000 times. Refer to [ModellingProcedure.md](https://github.com/Actuarial-Control-Cycle-Part-A-2023-T1/group-github-pages-erm-evidently-regretting-myprofession/blob/40651533f904d94cb505c8bf4228e864e078b443/ModellingProcedure.md) for a comprehensive look at the modelling procedure. The averages of these costs were then taken and the following results were produced. All costs are in 2021 figures.

## __3.1 Short Term with Program Economic Costs vs Without Program__  
In the short term, the costs across all SSP scenarios associated with the program are much higher than without the program. This can be attributed to the large buyback and rent costs which occur in the short term. A clear downtrend in costs with the program is observed as less buyback and rent offers are made and costs from emergency relocation are reduced. The non-program costs do not experience any clear trends in the short term. Both experience seasonality with costs spiking in the third quarter of each year. This is visualized in the following figure.

![ShortTermCostComparison](https://github.com/Actuarial-Control-Cycle-Part-A-2023-T1/group-github-pages-erm-evidently-regretting-myprofession/blob/9442ce1b9854f755e03fd8cf0584db69275d9377/ShortTermCostComparison.png)

## __3.2 Long term with Program Economic Costs vs Without Program__  
Over the long term, it is clear that the with policy SSP scenarios experience far less costs between the years 2030 to 2150 than their without policy counterparts. This is especially prevalent in the very high emissions SSP scenario which reaches costs nearing 8 billion Ꝕ by 2150 whilst with the policy it reaches about 2 billion Ꝕ. The very high and high emissions scenarios experience an uptrend after 2030, while the low and medium emissions scenarios experience an uptrend until around 2080 before down trending after that. This impacts the effectiveness of the program for the low and medium scenario as in the long term, the economic costs without the program decrease, making the initial investment into the buyback scheme less effective as the cost reduction becomes smaller. This is visualized in the following figure.

![LongTermCostComparison](https://github.com/Actuarial-Control-Cycle-Part-A-2023-T1/group-github-pages-erm-evidently-regretting-myprofession/blob/9442ce1b9854f755e03fd8cf0584db69275d9377/LongTermCostComparison.png)

## __3.3 Capital Requirements for Solvency__  
The average simulated cost was summarised in aggregate, where positive cash flows stem from initial capital and regular capital injections, negative cash flows are the simulated costs. The methodology adopted to determine capital requirements was the set of reasonable values such that at least 995 of the 1000 simulations produced a net positive cash flow under all climate change scenarios. This provides a 99.5% confidence in the solvency of the scheme. In order to reduce the solution space of capital the regular injection was fixed. The initial capital was then set as below (Ꝕ 1,000’s):

----- | WithScheme | Without Scheme
-----|-----|------
Initial Capital | 15,000,000 | 15,000,000 |
Yearly Capital | 1,384,190 | 3,858,250 |


## __3.4 Contrasting Voluntary vs Emergency Displacement Costs with Program__  
Clearly, voluntary costs are much higher in the short term due to the buyback and renting schemes, however, they quickly decrease and by 2030 are near zero. This results in the initial downtrend in short-term emergency displacement costs. After 2030, emergency displacement costs begin to rise for the very high and high emissions scenarios, while the medium scenario remains relatively stable, and the low emissions scenario remains stable up until about 2080 where a slight downtrend is observed. Emergency displacement costs with the program experience similar trends as without the program, however at a far reduced economic cost level; following the bulk of the relocation under the program. This is visualized in the following figure.

## __5.1 Key risks__  
###  __5.1.1 Model Risk__  
The model parameters are built on historical trends. A deviation in the assumed relocation acceptance rate will affect the short and long-term costs of the policy.  
* __5.1.1.1 Analysis__  
The sensitivity of the model to a change in assumptions was performed by adjusting the relocation acceptance rates and performing 100 simulations under the Very High Emissions scenario.  

Sensitivity Scenario | Impact
-----|------
-1% initial relocation acceptance rate | Short term costs: -10 billion dollars<br/>Long term costs: +30 billion dollars |
+1% initial relocation acceptance rate | Short term costs: +10 billion dollars<br/>Long term costs: -30 billion dollars |

>TO DO, add Excel + R code
* __5.1.1.2 Mitigation__  
Careful monitoring of the actual vs expected costs year on year will allow the team to adjust the model parameters to better reflect the relocation appetite of Storslysian residents.  

###  __5.1.2 Public Backlash__  
Residents living in high-risk areas can view the policy as a forceful method to evict homeowners. Additionally, residents and politicians may lobby against the policy as they may advocate against taxpayer-funded social insurance programs. This can cause the implementation of the scheme to be negatively impacted if it faces resistance from the population of Storslysia.  
* __5.1.2.1 Analysis__  
Public backlash can lead to lower relocation acceptance rates and funding difficulties. We deemed the likelihood of this risk to be relatively high with the impact to be middling. 
* __5.1.2.2 Mitigation__  
Public education on the policy and its key benefits and risks to better inform the public of the benefits of relocation. Consistent promotion of the policy through multiple mediums of communication will increase exposure and awareness of the scheme.  


###  __5.1.3 Extreme Climate Change__  
The frequency and severity of natural disasters are greatly impacted by climate change. This, in turn, can exacerbate the damages and costs incurred by the government.  
In the event of extreme climate change, the sustained costs can be extremely high and possibly un-operable.  
* __5.1.3.1 Analysis__  
The model looks at cost projections for four emission scenarios. The Very High emission scenario emphasises uncontrolled climate change growth which would greatly increase the frequency and severity of catastrophic events. (Refer to Figure 5.4). This scenario would result in extreme projected losses year on year for Storslysia from 2050 onwards.  
![Projected costs under different emissions scenarios](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/129591024/229518402-5b975e91-4821-4c15-8bd8-bb91538fe9b3.png)
>TO DO, add Excel + R code
* __5.1.3.2 Mitigation__  
Increased coverage of the buyback scheme can further mitigate some costs if we foresee uncontrolled progression into a Very High emissions scenario. This risk can be periodically monitored to allow proactive updates to the scheme.
